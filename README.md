# IoT-Temperature-Monitoring-System-with-Mobile-App-Integration
The project combines ESP8266 microcontrollers and temperature sensors to create a system that monitors temperature remotely. Through a mobile app, users can access real-time data, receive alerts for anomalies, and control devices based on temperature conditions.
